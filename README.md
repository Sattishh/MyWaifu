## MyWaifu
<blockquote> MyWaifu: A mobile app that allows you to choose, customize and watch your very own waifu!  </blockquote>

## üì≤About MyWaifu
MyWaifu is an Augmented Reality app that allows users to have their own choice of "partner" in their phone. Users are able to choose between various waifu types and buy clothes for their waifu.

After clicking one of the panels in the home page, users can view their waifu through their camera via Google Scene Viewer!

Since this is a demo app, some of the code hasn't been changed from the flutter template we used as the base of this project to make UI and sign up process easier. Note that all the Augmentated Reality, Waifu Types and Shopping Choices were made from scratch in only 12 hours of work, including research time since we're begineers.

## üöÄTeam
The MyWaifu mobile app was developed by a group formed during the Flutter Bootcamp organized by Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) Asia Pacific University and University of Malaya. After learning basics of Flutter in the workshops, we worked together to finish the project from scratch under 12 hours through the night, to pitch it the next day!
